        <label class="desc-text">
            The 52-week Price strategy is based on a stock's price momentum. As far as stocks are concerned, momentum means the spead at which the stock varies (going up or down). Stocks which are considered to be risky may go higher and higher, whereas stocks which are low or less risky may go even lower.
            <br />
            One of the simpler ways to measure the momentum of the price is to find out how close the stock is to the 52-week high or low. The formula which was used for this is :
            (Close-week52Low)/Week52High-Week52Low)

            According to Raja Singh Ravi:
            <br />
            <i>“In this assignment, I have designed the controller and view for the application. Also, I worked on the part where we have to make the controller communicate with the views. I learned how this communication works in an MVC application. Also, I got to know about the importance of tempdata.”</i>

            <i>“I found the stock trading application very helpful, in such a way that it gave me a better understanding of the MVC architecture. Also, this is the second assignment in which I had made use of Git. Hence, I was able to get an even better understanding of how the Git repository works. As far as this application is concerned, I worked on the IEXTrading APIs and made batch calls to pull Stock Quotes for all the symbols. Read IEXTrading Developer documnetation to understand about the data and datatypes.”</i>

            According to Azeem Syed:
            <br />
            <i>“I had gone through the document which had  been posted as part of the assignment and went through the links which had been provided. After going through these links, I got an idea regarding the stock picking strategies. The strategy which I had picked for stock-picking was the 52 week strategy. This is the strategy which we have implemented in the code. Using this strategy, we wrote code to pick the best 5 stocks from the total.”</i>
